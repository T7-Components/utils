# utils

"utils" is a collection of utilities that have been currated from multiple projects to perform simple targeted tasks.

The entire library can be imported (```import utils from 'utils'```) or individual utilities can be imported as needed to keep production code bases as small as possible (```import { ajax, log } from 'utils'```).
